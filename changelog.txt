- Fixed items disappearing when shift-clicked into the Tinkerer's reforge slot
- Fixed some UI elements not scaling correctly with other UI (namely the Forge Hammer's tooltip extension)
- Fixed the Forge Hammer's anvil minigame registering clicks twice in a single update, making it inherently easier
