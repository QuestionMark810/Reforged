Reforged! aims to improve the process of reforging gear using a unique minigame and minor quality of life changes.

Reforging now takes longer but rewards the player based on their performance.
Consecutive reforges are less likely to result in repeat prefixes and no longer charge the player, until they fail.
After using a certain permanent upgrade, some items can be 'forged' rather than crafted to improve their quality.

The cost of reforging is configurable.

This mod may be incompatible with other mods that modify reforge behaviour. Feel free to report incompatibilities on the Workshop page.
