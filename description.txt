Reforged! aims to improve the process of reforging gear using a unique minigame and minor quality of life changes.

Reforging now takes longer but rewards the player based on their performance.
Consecutive reforges will rarely result in repeat prefixes and no longer charge the player, until they fail.
After using a new permanent upgrade sold by the Goblin Tinkerer, some items can be 'forged' rather than crafted to give more favourable initial prefixes.

The cost of reforging is configurable.

This mod may be incompatible with other mods that modify reforge behaviour. Feel free to report incompatibilities on the Workshop page.
